Place the official FlashDelivery PNG here as `flashdelivery.png`.

Steps:
1. Save the PNG you attached to the project `public` folder with the filename: flashdelivery.png
2. The login page already references `/flashdelivery.png`.

If you want me to add the attached PNG file directly, reply "Sim, adicione" and I'll import it for you.
